    Jaimini Sama Vedam 
This project converts the Sama Vedam text present in the pdf file S1.pdf into Unicode text. The document was created using a propreitary font called Krishna Vedic.  These are the steps done to convert the document

  Extract the embedded fonts from the Adobe PDF document using an online tool. These fonts are stored in the directory fonts. The majority of the texts are using the Krishna Vedic font
  
  Create a set of unique ascii characters present in the PDF file and print the characters using that font. 
  
  Use a tool like FontBook (in Mac) to find the corresponding Unicode values. 
  
  Create the mapping in the file char_map.py 
    
  Take care of certain idiosynchorancies (e.g.) some characters needs to be reversed . Some need a different ordering

  The mapping is present in the file <a href="output_text/mapping.html">output_text/mapping.html</a>

  The generated text file is present in <a href="output_text/output_grantha.txt">output_text/output_grantha.txt</a>

  This can be converted into other Unicode languages like Devanagari etc. using converters like <a href="https://www.aksharamukha.com/converter">Aksharamuka</a>.
